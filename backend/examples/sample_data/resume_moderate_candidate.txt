ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

I'm really excited about the potential of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. While most of my experience has been with simpler chatbot implementations and basic LLM integrations, I've been actively learning about more advanced agent frameworks like LangGraph and AutoGen through personal projects and online courses.

My experience with production systems is primarily at smaller scale - handling thousands of requests rather than millions. I'm comfortable with the fundamentals of API development, database design, and cloud deployment, but less experienced with complex distributed systems or advanced orchestration patterns.

I work best when I have clear requirements and can iterate based on feedback. I'm a quick learner and not afraid to dive into documentation or ask questions when facing unfamiliar challenges. I stay current with AI developments by following research papers and experimenting with new tools.

Areas I'm actively working to improve:
- Deeper understanding of LangGraph and complex agent orchestration
- More experience with vector databases and advanced RAG techniques
- Building larger-scale systems with proper monitoring and observability
- Advanced prompt engineering and evaluation frameworks
- System design for high-traffic applications

I have some experience with async Python but haven't built extensively asynchronous systems. My understanding of streaming LLM responses is mostly theoretical from tutorials. I've used function calling in toy projects but haven't implemented it in production at scale.

Looking for opportunities to work with experienced engineers who can mentor me in building production-grade agentic systems. Comfortable with remote work and flexible on travel for team meetings or training.
