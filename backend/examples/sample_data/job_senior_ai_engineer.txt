Senior AI Engineer - Agentic Systems & Multi-Agent Orchestration

Company: TechFlow AI

About the Role:
We are seeking an exceptional Senior AI Engineer to join our platform team, focusing on building production-grade agentic systems and multi-agent orchestration frameworks. You will be responsible for designing, implementing, and scaling autonomous agent systems that leverage large language models to solve complex business problems.

Key Responsibilities:
- Design and implement multi-agent systems using frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, or CrewAI
- Build production-ready agentic workflows with proper error handling, state management, and observability
- Architect agent orchestration patterns including hierarchical, sequential, and parallel coordination strategies
- Integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) into production systems with proper cost optimization and latency management
- Develop custom tools and function calling interfaces for agent capabilities
- Implement advanced prompting techniques including chain-of-thought, ReAct, and self-reflection patterns
- Build evaluation frameworks and monitoring systems for agentic behavior
- Collaborate with product teams to identify opportunities for autonomous agent deployment
- Mentor junior engineers on LLM integration and agent design patterns

Required Qualifications:
- 5+ years of software engineering experience with strong Python proficiency
- 2+ years of hands-on experience building production LLM-powered applications
- Deep understanding of agentic frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, AutoGen, or similar)
- Proven track record of deploying multi-agent systems to production at scale
- Strong knowledge of prompt engineering, RAG patterns, and LLM optimization techniques
- Experience with distributed systems, async programming, and state management
- Familiarity with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) and semantic search
- Strong understanding of LLM APIs, token optimization, and cost management strategies
- Experience with observability tools for LLM applications (LangSmith, Weights & Biases, etc.)
- Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to debug complex agent behaviors

Nice to Have:
- Experience with agent evaluation frameworks and automated testing for LLM systems
- Knowledge of fine-tuning techniques and model customization
- Background in reinforcement learning or autonomous systems
- Contributions to open-source LLM/agent projects
- Experience with streaming responses and real-time agent interactions
- Understanding of AI safety, alignment, and responsible AI practices
- Experience with function calling, tool use, and external API integration patterns
- Knowledge of graph-based workflow orchestration and state machines

Technical Environment:
- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- LangGraph, LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector databases
- Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP
- GitHub Actions, monitoring and observability tools

What We Offer:
- Competitive compensation with equity
- Work on cutting-edge AI agent technology
- Collaborative team environment with top-tier engineers
- Flexible remote work options
- Professional development budget for conferences and courses

This role requires deep technical expertise in agentic AI systems and the ability to translate research concepts into production-ready implementations. You should be comfortable with ambiguity, rapid iteration, and the evolving landscape of LLM capabilities.
