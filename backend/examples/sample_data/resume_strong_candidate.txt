PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Senior AI Engineer | Autonomous Systems Team
VectorAI Inc. | San Francisco, CA | Jan 2022 - Present

- Architected and deployed multi-agent customer support system using LangGraph, processing 50K+ conversations/month with 85% resolution rate without human intervention
- Built hierarchical agent orchestration framework supporting 12 specialized agents (routing, analysis, action, verification) with state management and error recovery
- Implemented advanced prompting patterns including ReAct, chain-of-thought, and self-reflection, improving task completion rates by 40%
- Designed custom tool-calling interfaces integrating 15+ external APIs (Stripe, Zendesk, Salesforce) with proper retry logic and fallback strategies
- Reduced LLM API costs by 60% through prompt optimization, caching strategies, and intelligent model routing (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 vs Claude)
- Developed comprehensive evaluation framework using LangSmith, tracking agent behavior across 200+ test scenarios with automated regression testing

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

Strong believer in systematic evaluation and testing for LLM systems. Experienced with building retry logic, error handling, and graceful degradation for unpredictable LLM behaviors. Comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces and rapidly iterating based on user feedback. Enjoy staying current with latest research (regularly read arXiv papers on agents, RAG, and prompting techniques).

Some areas I'm actively learning: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), fine-tuning techniques for specialized domains, and advanced RAG patterns like HyDE and query decomposition. Less hands-on experience with model training infrastructure and distributed training at very large scale (billions of parameters), though familiar with concepts.

Available for remote work, open to occasional travel for team collaboration or conferences.
