# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive development, testing, and analysis.

## Planned Notebooks

- `testing_workflow.ipynb` - Interactive workflow testing and debugging
- `prompt_engineering.ipynb` - Prompt template development and refinement
- `data_exploration.ipynb` - Analysis of evaluation results and patterns

## Setup

To use notebooks, ensure you've installed the notebook dependencies:

```bash
pdm install -G notebooks
```

Then launch Jupyter:

```bash
pdm run notebook
```

Notebooks will be added as development progresses.
